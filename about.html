            <p>
                Here I am in 2018 at the clinic, as proud as can be at the birth of my second son, I had no idea what was waiting for me around the corner. Building this website and baring the deepest parts of my private life to the world is something I never thought I would have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                My story is as follows, on the 21st June 2021 I dropped of my children Kenta and Shota at their nursery as I usually did; at this time my ex-wife and I were relatively happily co-parenting the boys. From August 2020 to June 2021 my ex-wife and I had been sharing the care of the children.
                We had separated in August 2020 and divorced later that year in December. The divorce was amicable. We both went to the city hall and signed the papers together. My ex-wife had made a divorce agreement which I thought guaranteed my access to the children. I was apprehensive but I granted
                full custody rights to my ex-wife without knowing the full extent of what that meant. In my mind I was convinced that she would treat me fairly, there was just no way she was going to separate the children and I. My relationship with my children was extremely close and I loved them dearly.
                During the co-parenting period I would pick up the boys on Friday afternoon and drop them back at the nursery on Monday morning. My ex-wife would have the children during the week. There were many times that my ex-wife would ask me to take the children for longer periods,
                sometimes for the whole week. There was never any complaint about my care for the children and she happily asked me to look after the children whenever she needed help. However, later that day, on the 21st June 2021, I received a LINE message stating that it is better
                that I do not see the boys for a while and that I can not pick them up after nursery the following Friday as I usually did. I froze, I felt a chill run through every part of my body right out to the tips of my fingers and toes; I just knew at that point that she was
                going to take the children away from me. At first I pleaded with my ex-wife to allow me access to the children but to no avail. I tried pleading with her friends and family to put pressure on her to relent. My mother and my sister messaged her to plead with her to change her mind. It all fell on deaf ears.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, once I realised that there was no hope of appealing to her better nature I tried mediation through the Utsunomiya-city family court from October 2021, I thought it would be staright-forward at the court but I was completely wrong. She did not appear at any of the mediation meetings, which did not seem to bother any of the officials..
                Instead, she sent a lawyer as her representative who refused any pleas of mine to let me communicate with the children, even the use of a third-party organization to mediate visitation was refused. The courts bowed down to the demands of the lawyer and ignored my pleas. Finally, a judgment was made
                , the court ruled, in June 2022, that I could exchange pictures, letters and videos until April 2023, but could not communicate with the boys directly; from April 2023 we could then start the process of organising visitation and phone calls between myself and the children. This
                was utterly unsatisfactory but I accepted the ruling. I have sporadically received photos but I have never received videos or letters.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, April 2023 came about I contacted my ex-wife’s lawyer to start the planning for direct contact but was met with silence. I had no other option and hired a lawyer for the first time. My lawyer contacted my ex-wife’s lawyer it was then that I found out she has moved far away,
                that she is no longer using her lawyer as go-between and I am unable to obtain the whereabouts of my children. The current situation is that I have not communicated with my children since June 2021. I do not know where they are or the status of their well-being.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have found some support online and have been referred to a <a href="http://sakka-law-office.jp/english/index.html" target="_blank"> lawyer</a> that understands these types of cases well and wishes to reform Japanese law. I hope with help of this new lawyer I will be able to gain access to my beautiful boys.
                I hoped that I would never have to use a lawyer, go through the courts and go to extraordinary mesures like building this website. All of this energy, time and money could
                have gone directly to those children, to their well-being, their happiness and their prosperity; instead it is being thrown into a black hole. I am very lucky to have been refered to a lawyer that
                I can trust because the single-custody system is ideally placed to be abused by nefarious lawyers. Lawyers deliberately exploit the system to make money from the misery of parents. As I was coming to terms with my own situation I was also coming to terms
                with the utter failure of Japanese family law and the family court system, and also realising that lawyers were deliberately gaining the system. It has been an eye-opening road to say the least but one must persevere, giving up is not an option.'
            </p>

            <p>
                I have subsequently remarried and have a good life with my wife. All I want to do is fulfill my responsibilities and duties to my children, Kenta amd Shota. I do not understand why the Japanese family courts
                do not support me in this endeavour.
            </p>

             <p>
                Thus the purpose of this website is three fold; firstly, to act as a place where my children might find me in the future if the family couts fail; two, to tell my story; and finally, to highlight
                the absurdity of the single-custody system, the Japanese family law system and exploitation by lawyers.

                        This was a mantra that I used to tell the boys, I said you need all three of these things to do well in life. You need to study and learn for your mind;
                        you need to keep fit and healthy for your body; and you need to be in control of your emotions for your heart. It is a quaint little thing but I wanted the boys
                        to learn the idea of self-discipline from an early age. Now it is me who has to employ all of these to keep on fighting in this difficult situation.

                        Signing over full custody rights to my ex-wife is the most naive mistake of my life and the most poorly researched. In Japan, once you sign
                        over the rights you do not just sign over complete control to the other parent you also forfeit any rights you have to your children. For
                        example there is no way for me to find out right now if my children are alive or dead, or if my wife were to become incapacitated the children
                        do not automatically get passed to the next biological parent. According to Japanese law I have as much right to my children, as you, the reader.

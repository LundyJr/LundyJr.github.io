                    <p>
                        From the moments you were born I was there.
                        You made me the proudest man I could be. We used to spend
                        so much time playing around the apartment with all
                        of your favourite toys. I devoted my life to you and you rewarded
                        me everyday with your laughter and smiles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a family and as a single daddy we went to many places.
                        We were always going to parks, to museums, to the shops,
                        to special places like aquariums and theme parks. I did my best
                        to expose you to the world and all the fun and beautiful things
                        in it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was my job to pick you up and drop you off at
                        the nursery everyday. Everyday I had a little heart break
                        leaving you there but I trusted your teachers and knew you would
                        be happy there. I attended your open days, had good
                        relationships with your teachers and cheered you on at Sports
                        Day. During my single daddy days I would miss you so much during the week,
                        when it was my turn to pick you up on Friday afternoon
                        I would race to get to nursery after work, my whole body buzzing
                        with excitement. I would give the world to have that feeling again.

                    <p>
                        This picture was taken not long before I last saw you.
                        A good friend of mine drove us to a big theme
                        park, we rode the attractions, ate ice-cream and enjoyed the sunny weather.
                        You both wanted to be held and cuddled so much.
                        We were a team, daddy and his boys, father and sons on a day out.
                        I have so many photos of all our days out and fun times
                        that we had together. The happiest moments of my life! But I know in my heart
                        there are more to come. I love you boys, we will meet again.
